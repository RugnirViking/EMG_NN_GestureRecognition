# EMG NN Gesture Recognition
This repository is for the project created by ROB3 - group 368

It is a series of solutions designed to read EMG data from 8 forearm mounted sensors and categorise the data into a recognised hand gesture. This is used as part of a control setup for controlling a telechir for use in nuclear power plant maintenence.
